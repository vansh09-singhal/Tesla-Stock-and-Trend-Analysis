st.header("Project Purpose & Motivation")

st.write("""
While many projects jump directly into building complex models or applying machine learning,  
I chose to take a step back and focus on something more foundational: **data understanding**.

Tesla, being a volatile and influential stock, offered the perfect dataset to showcase how much can be uncovered just through:
- Clean SQL queries,
- Visual exploration using Python (matplotlib),
- And strong storytelling.

---

Too often, raw data is fed into models without being truly understood.  
But **data becomes powerful only when deeply explored** â€” patterns, anomalies, trends, and relationships must be revealed before any modeling has real meaning.

This project was a conscious decision to build that **core analytical mindset** â€” to treat data as more than numbers, but as a source of insight.

In a way, this isn't a "simple" project â€” it's a **strategic foundation** for everything more advanced that comes next in my data career.
